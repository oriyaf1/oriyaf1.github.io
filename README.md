# Motivation

# Tools

I built it with ðŸ’— in vanilla js, it is indeed a headache ðŸ¥´ but I wanted to show this skill,

I have implemented several services, which come in the libraries and frameworks straight out of the box, such as router, animations, logger and so.
From ×¦×˜ experience of every writing like this you build a kind of frontend library that suits your needs, I tried to avoid it and code more in programming method that is more inclined to the functional programming than to object-oriented programming.

In any case, it's fun to sometimes touch the core of the DOM and touch the lower level of things, and I enjoyed the creation and the writing.

certainly for clients I will use the appropriate front end framework (Angular react etc.).
